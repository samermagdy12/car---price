# Car Price Prediction Model

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the price of used cars based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and condition. This project serves as a demonstration of a complete data science workflow, from data cleaning and exploration to model training and evaluation.

## 🚀 Setup and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites
*   Python 3.x

### Installation
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/samermagdy12/car_price_prediction.git
    cd car_price_prediction
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` file is recommended for a complete project. If one is not present, you will need to install necessary libraries manually.)*

### Example Usage
This repository currently contains only a `README.md`. To complete the project, you would typically add:
1.  A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) for the data analysis and model training.
2.  A dataset file (e.g., `.csv`).
3.  A `requirements.txt` file.
